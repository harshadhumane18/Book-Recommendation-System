### Recommendation system:
A recommendation system is a tool or software that suggests items (like movies, books, products) to users based on their preferences and past interactions. It analyzes user behavior, 
such as purchase history or ratings, to predict and offer items that the user might like or find useful. The aim is to enhance user experience by providing personalized suggestions,
making it easier for users to discover new things they might enjoy.

#### Types of recommendation system:
1. **Content-Based Recommendation System**: Recommends items similar to those a user has liked before, focusing on the characteristics or features of the items.
2. **Popularity-Based Recommendation System**: Suggests items based on their overall popularity or the number of interactions (views, purchases, ratings) they have received, without
3. considering user preferences.
4. **Collaborative-Based Recommendation System**: Recommends items based on similarities between users. It identifies patterns by analyzing user behavior or preferences to make suggestions.
5. **Hybrid Recommendation System**: Utilizes a combination of different recommendation techniques (such as content-based, collaborative-based, or others) to provide more accurate and
6. diverse recommendations to users.
